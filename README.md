# About My Portfolio Site

## Planning and Design

- I set out to re-design my portfolio site with only CSS (no libraries or frameworks). 

- My goal was to use a minimalist design, utilizing just a few fonts and colors.

- Using https://excalidraw.com/ I sketched a mockup, and I think I got very close to the original idea!

I wanted a clean and simple asthetic, and I believe I have achieved that.
