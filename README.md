# About My Portfolio Site

www.jamescox.dev is the third iteration of my portfolio. Each version is a React single page application, but this is the first one that does not use a CSS framework. 

The first version was built following a tutorial, and made use of IBM's Carbon Components, which was so unwieldy and an incredibly large package to include for such a simple project. 

The second version I designed myself, this time using Material UI's components and design aesthetic. Material UI is a lot more intuitive, and definitely more light weight than Carbon Components, but there is no escaping that it looks very Material UI-ey, which means it looks like a lot of things on the web, as Google uses Material UI components for so many of its producsts.

This version is the first version to use only CSS and the first one that is "single page" style, with smooth scrolling and no "pages".

## Planning and Design

- I set out to re-design my portfolio site with only CSS (no libraries or frameworks). 

- My goal was to use a minimalist design, utilizing just a few fonts and colors.

- Using https://excalidraw.com/ I sketched a mockup, and I think I got very close to the original idea!

Design vs. Actual

I wanted a clean and simple aesthetic, and I believe I have achieved that.
